# Chess Game Project

Welcome to our Chess Game Project! This game is a labor of love by [Jacob Wolman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-wolman-084277287/) and [Chaim Inje](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chaim-inje/). 



## About the Game

This is not just any chess game. We've designed it to be interactive, user-friendly, and challenging for all levels of chess enthusiasts. You can test your skills against a computer opponent, or challenge a friend to a match. 

## Features

- **Play against the computer**: Our game includes an AI opponent that you can play against. Don't underestimate it, it might surprise you!
- **Play against a friend**: Want to challenge a friend? Our game allows two players to play against each other. 
- **User-friendly interface**: We've made the game easy to navigate, so you can focus on your strategy and enjoy the game.

We hope you enjoy playing this game as much as we enjoyed creating it. Checkmate!
